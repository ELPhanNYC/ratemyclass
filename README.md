# RateMyClass (Version 2)

Note: This is an updated version of the previous *RateMyClass* app. This iteration of the app is sreated with the MEAN stack.

Stemmed from the fact that our current university (SUNY University at Buffalo) does not release course evaluation for students to view. As a student, it is important to be able to gauge the difficultly of a class and the obtain feedback from previous students of said class.
